## Description
This application helps generate cards of team members with some information (such as email, employee id, id, github...)for each. 
<br><br>

## Installation
My project can be installed through my github repository. It did not start with any starter code. 
<br><br>

## Usage
This application can be used to track and hae a central place for team members. Each card has contact information of each individual person and their relationship to the team. This can be used as a central directory for those who are within a team. For example, when start group projects this can be used to help team members get connected.
